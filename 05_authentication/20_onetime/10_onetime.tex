\section{Onetime}\label{onetime}}

This section is about codes that can be only used once.

Of course the problem with codes that can be used just once is that
there is a distribution problem.

In earlier times, this was solved by creating a codebook with two copies
- one for the sender and one for the receiver.

In modern times there are time based codes, that depend on minimizing
the difference between local clocks.
