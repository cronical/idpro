# IDPro
Demo to experiment with IDPro Body of Knowledge techniques

## Tools needed
1. Tool for intake of various formats - accept docx, md, and tex
2. Source management tool - manage revisions, allow for distributed collaboration
3. Composition tool - compile inputs into output format(s)

4. Visual editor(s) - for productivity need word processing style editor
5. Tracking mechanism for provenance of content - author and copyright holder at a minimum.

## Tools in play

1. The open source pandoc provides reasonable translation between the three listed formats.  However, there are some considerations with graphics, tables etc.
2. The use of *git* and *github* provides a strong facility to manage the storage and versioning of the content in a controlled collaborative way.
3. Two options for composition of the components have been identified. 
   * Latex - very long  history with *a lot* of industry support.  However, there is a learning curve.
   * MS Word Master documents.  Master documents can do the job, but they have a terrible reputation as being finicky and even corrupting files.  
4. For visual editing MS Word is widely known but various Markdown editors may be workable (e.g. this is written on Typora)
5. The mechanism for tracking content is probably best done with meta data on the content itself.  Tagging in *git* should be explored.
